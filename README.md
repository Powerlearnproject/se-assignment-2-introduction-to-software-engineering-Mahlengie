# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
 
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design development and maintenance of software.
It applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design,analysis and implementation of software systems.
Programming, on other hand,is,mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Planning, analysis, design,development, testing, implementation and maintenance 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is open to adaptation, encourages experimentation and welcomes changes of directions even later phases of the project.
Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined and goal.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Agile Complex deliverables.
Frequent iterations and refinements.
Rapid delivery times
multiple stakeholders.
Waterfall Simple scope and requirements gathering  
Clear and linear sequence of tasks.
structure processes  
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
It's not only helps the various software process teams but also helps the management to meet the constraints of cost,time and resources.
The process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying  validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a  software system. 
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
In software design, modularity refers to a logical partitioning of the "software design" that allows complex software to be manageable for the purpose of implementation and maintenance. 
With modular design,new functionalities and features can be added to specific modules without affecting the entire system. 
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
It effiently manages and tracks changes to code over time,facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking.
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
They are sofware  tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
keep versions around for as long as we need them.
track version of a project,not a single files.
Restore old versions, in whole or in part.
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Sofware project managers responsibilities are to analyze project constraints,establish the project objectives,coordinate the projects internal and external teams,construct the project timeliness and monitor the projects key performance indicators 
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance is an integral part of the software lifecycle that involves the modifying and updating  software  after it has been deployed.
Improving the sofware overall,correcting issues or bugs ,to boost performance. 
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Addictive design
Corporate ownership of personal data
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information. 
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
